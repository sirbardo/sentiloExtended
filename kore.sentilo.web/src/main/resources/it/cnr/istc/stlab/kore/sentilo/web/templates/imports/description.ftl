FRED is a tool for automatically producing RDF/OWL ontologies and linked data from natural language sentences. 
The method is based on Combinatory Categorial Grammar, Discourse Representation Theory, Linguistic Frames, and 
Ontology Design Patterns. Results are enriched with Named Entity Resolution (NER) and Word-Sense Disambiguation (WSD). 
A paper describing FRED has been published at EKAW 2012 (please refer to it in scientific publications).
